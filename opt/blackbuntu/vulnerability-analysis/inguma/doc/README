Inguma v0.4
-------------

Inguma is an open source penetration testing toolkit written completely in Python.
The environment was mainly oriented to attack Oracle related systems but, anyway,
it can be used against any other kind of systems.

What the fuck is "Inguma"?
--------------------------

Inguma is the name of a basque's mithological spirit who kills people while sleeping
and, also, the one who make the nightmares.

Who is the author?
------------------

The original author of Inguma is Joxean Koret, a basque software developer who mainly
works with Oracle products.

Currently is maintained by Hugo Teso and David Mart√≠nez.

For what purpose was it created?
--------------------------------

It is being created mainly for fun, not for (economic) profit but, of course, it can
be used to accomplish that kind of things.

It doesn't work for me!
-----------------------

Well, whether you are using the stable or the development version, we are committed to
offer our users the best possible experience.  Even so, our resources are limited and
we do our best to test the whole program, so if you find any problem, please open a
ticket in the project's bugtracker, available here:

http://inguma.eu/issues/

Thanks!

What the f*ck are "discover" and "gather" modules?
--------------------------------------------------

Discover modules are used to detect networks and hosts; gather modules are used to
determine what services are listening at the host, what operative system is being
used, what service pack, etc...

It doesn't work "always" in Win32!
----------------------------------

I'm working in this subject but is hard work. There is no well support for raw
sockets or, well, no "easy" support. In example, many of the modules (gather mainly)
which uses the Scapy library will have problems in Win32 distribution.

In my tests the unique platform which works without any problems is MS Win2k so, my
recomendation is the following: If you want to use it under Win32 use Win2k or hack
it to work against your platform. And, of course, send these patches back to me ;)

Anyway, I tested it under Win2k3 and WinXP SP2 and, with a little bit of hack sometimes
you will get a working Inguma version.

I want to collaborate!
----------------------

Ok. Send patches and/or ideas to the bug tracker or our development list
(inguma-devel@inguma.eu) and we will take a look. Help in this open source project
(as in any other OS project) is very needed.

Can I use it for commercial purposes?
-------------------------------------

Of course, but you need to comply with the GPL v2 License, which allows the
commercial use of it.

I created a new module for Inguma. Now, what?
---------------------------------------------

Send it to me and I will add to the next release.

Trace module doesn't work!
--------------------------

The module "trace" and many other that needs raw socket manipulation requires Inguma
to be executed as "root" under Unix or Unix like boxes or as Administrator under Win32
boxes (or a user in the Administrator groups, of course).

Module smbclient/rpcdump/samrdump doesn't works!
------------------------------------------------

You need to download and install Impacket from here:

http://oss.coresecurity.com/projects/impacket.html

In the near future it will be replaced with the scapy implementation, surely.

There is no GUI!
----------------

Inguma comes with 2 functional GUIs: text-based and PyGTK-based. If you don't have a
graphical display, PyGTK will not work.

No module named cx_Oracle
-------------------------

When you tries to use any Oracle related module you may found that error. You need to
download and install yourself that library from the following location:

http://www.cxtools.net/default.aspx?nav=cxorlb

apps11i: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'NoneType' objects
--------------------------------------------------------

The "apps11i" module is a little bit buggy. If you launchs the module against a non Oracle
E-Business Suite 11i server you will notice that error. Try launching it against one ;)

protoscan: global name 'conf' is not defined
--------------------------------------------

Due to an unknown (at the moment) to me reason Scapy fails reporting that the target being
scanned doesn't exist. If you get the problem with an existent target, please, open a ticket!

How can I create shellcodes?
----------------------------

At the moment only x86 procesor-based shellcodes for Linux and OpenBSD can be created. To
learn using PyShellcodeLib (the library used for that purpose) take a look to the file
$INGUMA_DIR/lib/pyshellcodelib, mainly, to the file pyshellcodelib.py, which comes with
an example that prints a C based program ready to run your shellcodes.

Is PyShellcodeLib Free?
-----------------------

Yes, it's completely free. GPL'ed. Version2. In fact, that library is a replacement for the
non-free (as in freedom) library InlineEgg of CORE Impact.

How to disassemble, to do a bindiff, etc...?
--------------------------------------------

Read the corresponding README file: $INGUMA_DIR/dis/README.
