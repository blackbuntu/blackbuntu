# Blue Eye
Blue Eye is a python Recon Toolkit script. It shows Shodan info, ports and headers. Subdomain resolves to the IP addresses, company email addresses and much more ..!

To run Blue Eye, all it takes is a domain and company name when prompted.


# Shodan
For additional data gathering, you can enter a Shodan API key when prompted.
Blue Eye will show the company's data, the open ports. It also shows you the Headers, on which you can determine whether they are vulnerable.

A Shodan API key can be found here: 
https://account.shodan.io/register


## Furthermore it shows the:

* Mail Servers.
* DNS Text Records.
* Nameserver Records.
* Sites of interest. "email, okta, webmail and slack"
* List of GitHub user pages.
* List of possible company email addresses harvested from GitHub user pages and from DuckDuckGo and Linkedin searches.
* Subdomain resolves to the IP addresses.

## Python:

I made this script in python 2.7 
(Later I can - I will change this to python 3) But for now I think python 2 is nicer, more beautiful and better. "It's kind of personal" ðŸ˜ƒ


## Install Blue Eye on Linux:

git clone https://github.com/BullsEye0/blue_eye.git

cd blue_eye

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Use:
python blue_eye.py

(You will be asked for a Shodan API key.
But this is not necessarily)

Have fun ..! ðŸ˜ƒ
